# shortest_path
Thi s is my second project.

First some requirement:

- Python 3.7 or higher.

- Numpy, PyQt5 and Cv2 are needed.

To use this program just start main.py.

Then you can draw the obstacles and then go to edit and start the program.

I want to say that if no path exists, then this will throw an error and stop the program. So I will fix this in the future. Secondly, I used only 1 algorithm, so I will add some new algorithm.
